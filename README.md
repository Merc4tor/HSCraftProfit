a calculator for hypixel skyblock profit
setup:
unpack the items.zip in the same folder as the python file

it will parse hypixelAPI data, neu data and skylea data

to create a file with (nearly) all the craftables and how much profit they make, some stuff you have to buy or sell on ah and most of the stuff on bazaar.
